# AI-Companion

This project aims to build an intelligent assistant that seamlessly integrates external documents and text with the vast knowledge of a large language model (LLM). The core functionality will allow users to input their own knowledge base—whether through documents, texts, or other forms of data—and combine it with the assistant’s existing knowledge to provide accurate, insightful, and context-aware guidance. The assistant will be able to help users analyze information, find solutions, clarify concepts, and even offer suggestions based on both the uploaded knowledge and the LLM’s understanding. Essentially, it will act as a powerful, hybrid tool for decision-making, problem-solving, and information discovery, capable of drawing on a personalized knowledge base while also tapping into the vast general knowledge of an AI system.

This could also act as a blueprint for:
- **Cover Letter Generation**: Using the user's documents, job descriptions, and personal details to craft tailored, compelling cover letters.
- **Resume Optimization**: Analyzing resumes to suggest improvements, keyword optimization, and more effective formatting based on industry standards.
- **Personalized Learning Assistant**: Guiding users through complex topics, offering explanations, quizzes, or personalized study material derived from a specific knowledge base.
- **Business Insights**: Analyzing business reports or data documents and providing actionable insights or strategy suggestions.
- **Creative Writing Aid**: Helping users with writing, brainstorming ideas, and even generating drafts or outlines for stories, articles, or essays.
- **Research Assistant**: Helping to synthesize academic papers, research materials, or data sets, providing summaries, recommendations, and research insights.
- **Idea Generation and Brainstorming**: Assisting in creative thinking by offering suggestions and generating ideas based on user input, context, or goals.
